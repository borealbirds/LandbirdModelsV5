#'@param aoi "Area of Interest". Defined and created via Melina's function(s). 
#'
#'@param species The species to be summarised. Default is `"all"` but can also be a `character` with names (common, scientific, or FLBCs) denoting the species of interest. We follow the taxonomy of the AOS 64th Supplement (July 21, 2023). 
#' Perhaps we can work a list of available species into an exported data.frame, e.g. via `usethis::use_data(unique(sample_id$sci_name))`. 
#' 
#'@param year The year(s) to estimate populations from. Default is `"all"` but can also be a `character` vector chosen a five year intervals starting from 1985, e.g. "1985", "1990",..."2020". 
#'
#'@return A population estimate (or estimates) of the mean and standard deviation density of males per hectare.
